# Accounting-Company_Webapp
This project aims to develop a Java-based web application for an accounting company with the utilization of HTML and CSS for interface presentation and styling. Each file will be separated into 2 main parts; a front-end web pages folder which consists mainly of HTML and CSS with some implementation of Java language which will be talked about later on. Therefore, most of the files in this folder will be JSP (JavaServer Page) which allows the mixed usage of Java and HTML. 

The second part is a back-end Source Package which uses Java language throughout. The OOP folder consists of JAVA classes that inherit object-oriented characteristics, the detailed explanation of this will be contained in the next part. The Servlet folder contains files that handle function requests from the web page JSP files such as the delete button.

Instruction on running the webapp:
1. Download the .war file and the mySQL database file called dump20240229
2. Connect the database file to port 3306
3. Open the .war file with the web server for running a web application such as Apache Tomcat
4. Ensure that the web server accesses localhost:8089 URL when running the web application
5. The username and password for the administrator account are:
 Username: Joe
 Password: 12345
8. You can create a new account and set the account role using this administrator account.
9. Enjoy testing the program!
